# fgrep-problem-benchmarks

The "fgrep problem" is to match a set of fixed strings in a corpus.  The
matching can be done "in parallel" by a DFA.

There are various methods to generate the DFA.

See the top of `fixed-strings.sh` for instructions on running these benchmarks.

[GrepFixedStrings() is compiled to 791 bytes of native code](//raw.githubusercontent.com/oilshell/blog-code/master/fgrep-problem-benchmarks/_gen/code-size.txt).  It has one or two variables, so all of them should fix in registers.
